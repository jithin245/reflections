How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Find the new modifications in that file to identify the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    Understand what changes are made at what time helps in bug fixing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    The main advantage is that user can have control of when to commit i.e no unneccessary commits are required.
    The disadvantage is that user may forget when to commit making commits too big.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is used in version control with multiple files such as a web document where files are related whereas in
    google docs we dont whether documents are connected or not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log gives the entire history including all the commit points Whereas git diff find the differences between two commit points.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    version control saves all the changes we made using commit. Therefore even if we made some errors, we can easily revert back to the 
    previous commit points.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To add changes to versions and get my name on it.
