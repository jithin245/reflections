What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git file that makes it a git respository. Only once you have created a this index file we can run 
git commands on that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the space where logical changes are made but not yet committed. By this we get a idea of changes that are yet to be 
committed. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Do commit once you added all the attributes of a logical change to the staging area. This ensures we have only one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If we want to experiment multiple versions for a file, branches would be helpful. We can switch to a branch and make changes for it without affecting other branch copies. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

By using diagrams, we can get a idea of branches in the flow and find the reachability of branch points to other commit points easily, rather looking at the log files and finding reachability would be tedious. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It merges the changes made by commits of both the branches ie insertions and deletions are merged wrt to the orginal file. Diagrams are easy to visualize and gives us idea of the commit points to be merged.
