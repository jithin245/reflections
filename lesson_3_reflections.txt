Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans : It helps in sharing your repository to other users. Also incase of failure of your local system, it provides us an 
alternative.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans : Sometimes user might not need all the updates in github remote repository. Pulling changes manually gives the user to use the desired content he/she wishes to work with.
